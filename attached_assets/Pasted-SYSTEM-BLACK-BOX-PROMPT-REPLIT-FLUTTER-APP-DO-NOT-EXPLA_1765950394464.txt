SYSTEM / BLACK-BOX PROMPT (REPLIT FLUTTER APP) — DO NOT EXPLAIN

Combine two fixes in one change-set:
(A) Quest Hub bottom bar polish (icon + active emphasis) and
(B) Today’s Verse reference/text sync so the displayed verse text always matches the displayed reference (no mismatches, no wrong fallback verse).

Hard constraints:

Do NOT change quest generation, XP, streak logic, expiration rules, completion flow, or storage schemas.

Do NOT add new screens or new features.

Keep current 3-tab bottom nav: Quest Hub (/), Bible (/bible), Profile (/profile).

Keep Quest Hub header flow unchanged: Welcome → Today’s Verse → Continue Reading.

Output a final STATUS UPDATE in the standard format.

========================
A) BOTTOM BAR POLISH

Goal: Make Quest Hub feel like “Home” and reduce the “empty space” feel without adding clutter.

Requirements:

Quest Hub icon

Replace the current Quest Hub icon (flag) with a clear “Home” style icon (house / home glyph).

Keep Bible and Profile icons unchanged.

Active tab emphasis (subtle, single treatment)

Add ONE subtle emphasis style to the currently selected tab:
Choose ONE of the following (do not combine):
a) a soft pill background behind the active tab icon+label OR
b) a soft glow/halo behind the active icon OR
c) a slightly larger active icon container

Do not change overall nav height drastically.

Keep labels visible (do not remove tab text labels).

Consistency

Keep inactive tabs minimal.

Ensure the active state is obvious but calm (no neon blast).

Files likely involved:

lib/screens/main_navigation.dart (or wherever bottom nav is implemented)

any shared theme/icon file if applicable

========================
B) TODAY’S VERSE REFERENCE/TEXT SYNC

Goal: Fix “Today’s Verse” so the text ALWAYS corresponds to the same reference shown (never show John 3:16 text under a different reference). If verse text isn’t found locally, show a safe placeholder rather than a mismatched verse.

Requirements:

Single source of truth

Use provider.getVerseOfTheDay() as the single source of truth for the displayed reference.

The displayed verse text MUST be looked up using that exact reference only.

Lookup behavior

First attempt: exact match (v.reference == votdRef)

Second attempt: normalized match (case-insensitive, trimmed whitespace, normalize spaces, handle common punctuation variations like ":" spacing)

If still not found: show placeholder text exactly:
"Tap to read this verse"

Never substitute a different verse’s text as a fallback.

Interaction

Keep the current styling and layout.

Tapping Today’s Verse should continue to navigate as it already does (do not change navigation behavior unless it’s currently broken).

Files likely involved:

lib/screens/quest_hub_screen.dart (Today’s Verse rendering + lookup)

any verse model/provider utilities if needed
