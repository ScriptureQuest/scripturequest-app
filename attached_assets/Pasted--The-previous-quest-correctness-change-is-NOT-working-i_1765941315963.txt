The previous quest correctness change is NOT working in runtime. Fix it by verifying actual runtime quest metadata and ensuring Start navigation + chapter completion progression are correctly wired end-to-end.

Observed failures:
- Waiting 45+ seconds on John 1 and tapping Complete Chapter does NOT progress the Nightly “read any chapter” quest.
- Tapping Start on a Psalms-themed quest still opens the last-read chapter (John 1), not Psalms.

Requirements:

1) Verify Runtime Quest Data (must be done)
- Add debug-only logs at the moment quests are rendered on QuestHubScreen and when Start is pressed:
  - quest id, title, questType, scriptureReference (if any), targetBook (if any), allowedBooks (if any), and whether it is considered action vs reflection.
- Confirm in logs that:
  A) “Nightly Reading / read any chapter” quests are questType == scripture_reading.
  B) Psalms-themed quests have targetBook == Psalms OR allowedBooks contains Psalms OR scriptureReference points to Psalms.

2) Fix Start Navigation for Psalms Quests
- Ensure Start uses this priority:
  A) scriptureReference (exact book+chapter) -> open reader there
  B) allowedBooks/targetBook -> open reader to that book (Psalms) at chapter 1 (or a sensible default)
  C) fallback -> last-read reference
- If Psalms quest lacks metadata at runtime, update the quest template/source so the metadata is actually assigned when the quest is created.

3) Fix Chapter Completion Progress Wiring (Nightly Any-Chapter)
- Ensure the Bible reader’s Complete Chapter action triggers quest progression with:
  - completedBook + completedChapter
  - hasMetReadingThreshold == true (existing 45s gate)
- Ensure quest_progress_service.onChapterComplete (or equivalent) is called from the reader completion path.
- Ensure scripture_reading quests with NO target metadata count ANY completed chapter.
- Ensure routine quests are NOT progressed by chapter completion (keep the safety change).

4) Do NOT change XP, rewards, streak logic, expiration rules, or UI layout.
- This is purely correctness: metadata assignment + Start routing + chapter completion wiring.

5) Output
- Provide a STATUS UPDATE including:
  - Exact files changed
  - The source where quest templates are defined/created and how metadata is assigned
  - Example debug log lines showing:
    a) a Psalms quest has targetBook=Psalms and Start opens Psalms
    b) a nightly any-chapter quest is scripture_reading and completes after John 1 completion
  - A test checklist for the two observed failures.

Make the minimal changes required so these two tests pass consistently.
