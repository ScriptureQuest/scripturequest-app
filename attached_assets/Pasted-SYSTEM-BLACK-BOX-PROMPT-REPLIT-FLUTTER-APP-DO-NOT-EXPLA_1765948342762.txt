SYSTEM / BLACK-BOX PROMPT (REPLIT FLUTTER APP) — DO NOT EXPLAIN

Next Change Set (Build v2.6): Simplify primary navigation to a 3-tab bottom bar and add inline streak visibility to the Quest Hub header, building on the latest QuestHub filter wiring fix (v2.5). Do NOT touch quest generation/progress logic.

Goals:
1) Reduce bottom navigation to 3 tabs for beta simplicity:
   - Quest Hub
   - Bible
   - Profile
2) Remove Avatar and Community from the bottom bar (back burner).
3) Keep Community/Explore content accessible from Profile instead.
4) Display streak in Quest Hub header inline to the RIGHT of “Welcome, {username}” (not under it).

Requirements:

A) Quest Hub Header (streak inline)
- In QuestHubScreen (lib/screens/quest_hub_screen.dart), keep the “Welcome, {username}” styling unchanged.
- Add a small inline streak indicator on the same row aligned to the right:
  - Icon: flame (🔥) or the existing flame icon
  - Show only if currentStreak >= 1
  - Format: flame icon + number only (e.g., “🔥 7”) OR “🔥 7d” if space is tight (choose the cleanest).
  - No extra card, no subtitle, no animation.
- Ensure this does not push Today’s Verse down excessively; keep header compact.

B) Bottom Navigation Simplification (3 tabs)
- In main navigation (lib/screens/main_navigation.dart or wherever the BottomNavigationBar is defined):
  - Remove Avatar tab and Community tab from the bottom bar entirely.
  - Bottom bar must contain exactly 3 items in this order:
    1) Quest Hub
    2) Bible
    3) Profile
  - Quest Hub remains the default landing destination (“/”) and first tab.
  - Ensure route detection/highlighting works correctly for these 3 tabs.

C) Preserve Routes (do not break deep links)
- Do NOT delete any screens/routes.
- Keep existing routes like /community and /avatar accessible via direct navigation if referenced elsewhere, but they must not appear in bottom tabs.
- Do NOT change QuestHub filter wiring logic from v2.5.

D) Move Community Access into Profile (simple section)
- In Profile screen (lib/screens/profile_screen.dart or equivalent), add a new section/card titled “Explore” or “Community”.
- Inside that section add simple navigation rows/buttons to:
  - Reading Plans (/reading-plans)
  - Friends (/friends) OR Journey Board (/journey-board) (use whatever exists)
  - Play & Learn (/play-learn)
  - Events/Seasonal Quests (link to /quests or /quests?filter=events if exists; otherwise omit)
- Keep it minimal and calm: no new complex UI, no “coming soon” spam.

E) Safety Constraints
- Do NOT modify:
  - quest generation logic, strict matching, quest progress services
  - XP/streak calculations or storage
  - Bible reader logic
- This prompt is navigation + header visibility only.

F) Output
- Provide a final STATUS UPDATE in the standard format:
  - Goal
  - What changed
  - What did NOT change
  - Files touched
  - Key logic notes
  - Quick test checklist
  - Known risks

Make minimal changes required to ship a simpler, quest-focused beta navigation.
