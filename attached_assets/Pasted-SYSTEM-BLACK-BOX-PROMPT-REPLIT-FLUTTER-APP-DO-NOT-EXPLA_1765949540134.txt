SYSTEM / BLACK-BOX PROMPT (REPLIT FLUTTER APP) — DO NOT EXPLAIN

Fix QuestHubScreen so (1) filter chip selection always matches the quest list being displayed, and (2) Today’s Verse always shows the correct verse text that matches its displayed reference.

PART A — FILTER CHIP SYNC (UI BUG)
1) Single Source of Truth
- Use ONE state variable: _activeFilter.
- BOTH the displayed quest list AND the selected chip highlight must be derived ONLY from _activeFilter.
- Remove any fallback/implicit filter logic that can show Weekly while _activeFilter is Tonight.

2) Chip Interaction
- On chip tap: setState(() => _activeFilter = selectedFilter)
- The quest list must immediately re-derive from _activeFilter.

3) Initialization
- _activeFilter defaults to Today/Tonight once on first build.
- After the user taps a chip, do not auto-switch filters.

PART B — TODAY’S VERSE MISMATCH (REFERENCE != TEXT)
Problem observed:
- Today’s Verse displays reference (e.g., 2 Corinthians 12:9) but shows incorrect verse text (e.g., John 3:16).
This means reference and verse text are coming from different sources.

Requirements:
1) Today’s Verse must be computed from ONE canonical source of truth:
- Get the Verse-of-the-Day reference via provider/service (e.g., getVerseOfTheDayReference()).
- Then fetch the verse text using that exact reference (same book/chapter/verse).
- Render reference + text from the same resolved object.

2) Hard rule:
- Never use last-read reference or Continue Reading fallback to populate Today’s Verse text.
- Continue Reading remains separate and can use last-read reference (with fallback to VOTD reference only if last-read is null).

3) Add a defensive sanity check (debug only):
- If the resolved verse text does not match the resolved reference (null/missing lookup), show a safe placeholder like:
  “Unable to load today’s verse.” (and do NOT substitute unrelated verses)
- Log a debug message in kDebugMode with both the reference and lookup result.

SAFETY CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT change quest generation, XP/streak logic, completion logic, or storage schemas.
- Do NOT change UI styling beyond what is necessary to fix the bugs.
- Keep header flow: Welcome → Today’s Verse → Continue Reading.

OUTPUT
- Provide a final STATUS UPDATE in the standard format.
- Explicitly state how Today’s Verse reference+text are kept in sync now.
- Explicitly state how filter state is kept in sync now.
