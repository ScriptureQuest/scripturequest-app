You are working in ScriptureQuest Flutter repo: ScriptureQuest/scripturequest-app.

TASK: Fix the Quest Hub filter pill highlight mismatch.
BUG: The quest list switches to Weekly quests, but the UI pill highlight remains on Tonight (seen in preview).
This means there are TWO sources of truth (one for list, one for selected pill). Unify them.

HARD CONSTRAINTS:
- Edit ONLY the Quest Hub filter state + pill rendering logic.
- Do NOT touch Verse of the Day, quest generation, persistence, or any service logic.
- Do NOT change UI styling besides which pill is “selected”.
- Keep changes minimal and local.

WHAT “FIXED” MEANS:
- If Weekly quests are being displayed, the Weekly pill MUST be highlighted.
- If Tonight/Daily quests are being displayed, Tonight pill MUST be highlighted.
- Same for Reflection and Events.
- On tap, the highlight and list must change together every time.
- If the screen restores state / auto-navigates to a filter, highlight must match the displayed list immediately.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT:
- Establish ONE single source of truth for the active filter (enum or string).
- Both:
  (1) which list is rendered AND
  (2) which pill isActive/selected
  must be derived from that same variable.
- Remove/stop using any duplicate state (e.g., selectedIndex for pills while list uses provider.filter, or vice versa).

STEPS:
1) Open lib/screens/quest_hub_screen.dart.
2) Find:
   - where the quest list is chosen (daily vs weekly vs reflection vs events)
   - where pills set selected/highlight
3) Make them use the SAME variable (prefer provider if it already exists; otherwise keep local state, but only one variable).
4) Verify in Preview:
   - click Weekly => Weekly highlighted + weekly quests shown
   - click Tonight => Tonight highlighted + daily/nightly quests shown
   - click Reflection => Reflection highlighted + reflection quests shown
   - click Events => Events highlighted + events quests shown

After change:
- run flutter test
- confirm preview behavior with a screenshot or clear confirmation

DO NOT change any other behavior.
