SYSTEM / BLACK-BOX PROMPT (REPLIT FLUTTER APP) — DO NOT EXPLAIN

Refine the Onboarding flow UI/UX only to better align with the current calm, readable, reassuring direction of the app. No changes to core logic, navigation structure, data models, XP, streak mechanics, or quest generation.

Goals

Make onboarding feel calm, grounded, and personal

Reduce abstraction and remove premature or meaningless concepts

Emphasize reading comfort and belonging

Avoid pressure, gamification, or overwhelm

Ensure onboarding visually and emotionally matches the current Quest Hub & Bible reader experience

Required Changes
1) Titles in Onboarding

Remove titles entirely from onboarding

Do NOT display “Pilgrim” or any title during onboarding

Titles should first appear post-onboarding (Profile or after first meaningful action)

No placeholder or preview titles during setup

2) Name Step (Identity)

Make name required

Remove “Skip” option

Copy should feel gentle, not demanding:

Example tone: “What should we call you?”

Keep helper text short and reassuring

Autofocus the text field on screen load

Do NOT introduce validation friction beyond non-empty input

3) Reading Comfort Screen (Visual Elevation Only)

Keep all existing controls:

Theme (Paper / Sepia / Night)

Text size slider (80%–160%)

Red letters toggle

Visually emphasize the scripture preview card:

Slightly increase elevation or shadow

Improve contrast against background

Add a touch more internal padding (not external spacing)

This screen should feel like a “moment of comfort”

No copy additions beyond what already exists

4) Reading Rhythm Screen

Keep the three choices exactly as-is:

Daily

A few times a week

I’ll explore at my own pace

Improve selected state clarity:

Subtle glow, border, or background emphasis

Add a single reassurance line below options:

“You can change this anytime.”

No streak or XP language here

5) Welcome & Beta Screens

Maintain minimal copy

No feature lists

No gamified language (XP, streaks, rewards)

Beta messaging remains informational only and non-alarming

6) Final Screen (“You’re Ready”)

Keep existing message and tone

Slightly improve visual hierarchy:

Increase contrast between headline and body text

Raise primary CTA slightly from bottom edge for comfort

No new interactions or explanations

Design Constraints

No scrolling on any onboarding screen

One primary action per screen

Maintain current typography, theme, and spacing system

No animations required beyond existing transitions

Onboarding should feel intentional, not empty or placeholder-like

Do NOT Change

XP logic

Streak logic

Quest logic

Storage schemas

Routes

Feature availability

Post-onboarding UI

Outcome

Onboarding should feel:

Calm

Personal

Reassuring

Focused on Scripture and comfort

Aligned with the rest of the app experience
