SYSTEM / BLACK-BOX PROMPT — ONBOARDING REFINEMENT (FLUTTER / REPLIT)

DO NOT EXPLAIN. IMPLEMENT ONLY.

Refine the onboarding experience to match the current calm, confident, and minimal tone of the app. Onboarding should feel reassuring, respectful of attention, and aligned with the Quest Hub + Bible Reader flow — not promotional or overwhelming.

Core Principles

Calm, grounded, faith-forward tone

Minimal steps (no more than necessary)

No feature overload

Respect user agency and pace

Match current UI density, spacing, and typography

STRUCTURE (Recommended Flow)
1) Welcome Screen (Purpose, Not Features)

Goal: Reassure the user, not sell them.

Title:
“Welcome to Scripture Quest”

Subtitle (low-contrast, supportive):
“A gentle way to build a daily rhythm with Scripture.”

No lists, no icons, no feature grid

Single primary button:
“Begin”

2) Reading Comfort Setup (Essential Only)

Goal: Let users feel comfortable immediately.

Text size selector (default = current app default, ~130%)

Reading style preview (Paper / Sepia / Night)

Jesus’ words in red toggle

Live preview sample verse (short, 1–2 lines)

Copy tone:

“Choose what feels easiest on your eyes. You can change this anytime.”

No advanced settings. No tooltips.

3) Reading Rhythm (One Question Only)

Goal: Personalize without pressure.

Single choice:

“Daily”

“A few times a week”

“I’ll explore at my own pace”

Subtext:

“This helps shape your quests. There’s no wrong choice.”

Do not show streaks, XP, or rewards here.

4) Optional Identity Touch (Lightweight)

Goal: Create ownership without friction.

Optional name field (or “Continue as Guest”)

Optional title preview (e.g., Pilgrim)

Skip button clearly visible

Copy:

“This is how your journey will be shown. You can change it later.”

5) Gentle Close (No Pressure CTA)

Goal: Transition into the app calmly.

Message:

“Your path is simple. Faithfulness grows in small steps.”

Primary button:
“Enter Quest Hub”

No animations beyond subtle fade/slide.
