You are the Replit Agent in ScriptureQuest/scripturequest-app.

THIS IS A REAL BUG. Do NOT say “already correct.” The screenshot shows:
- Weekly quest cards visible (purple “WEEKLY QUEST” tags)
- Tonight pill highlighted (cyan)
So list source != pill selection source.

GOAL: Make ONE source of truth drive BOTH:
(A) which quests are displayed AND
(B) which pill is highlighted

HARD CONSTRAINTS:
- Edit ONLY Quest Hub filtering/rendering. Do NOT touch VOTD, quest generation, persistence.
- Do NOT add new UI components.
- Minimal edits.

MANDATORY DEBUGGING (must do before fixing):
1) In lib/screens/quest_hub_screen.dart, identify the EXACT List<Quest> variable used by ListView.builder / rendering.
   - Print (kDebugMode) when building the list:
     - current _filter value
     - the list length
     - the first 3 quest IDs or titles
     - whether each quest is labeled DAILY/NIGHTLY/WEEKLY in your model
2) Identify the EXACT code path that selects that list.
   - If it is NOT the switch(_filter) you mentioned, you must locate the real selector.
3) Search for any provider-driven view selection in Quest Hub:
   - selectedTab, selectedFilter, currentQuests, showWeekly, activeFilter, mode, etc.
   - If provider is deciding the list, then the pills MUST set that provider value too.

FIX REQUIREMENT:
- There must be exactly ONE “active filter” variable.
- The list selector MUST depend only on that variable.
- Every pill tap MUST update that same variable (setState or provider notifyListeners).
- Remove/stop using any second selector that can override the list (even if it’s “helpful”).

VERIFICATION:
- Run in Preview and click:
  Tonight -> Weekly -> Reflection -> Events -> Tonight
After each click, log output must show:
  - active filter value matches highlighted pill
  - list content corresponds to that filter (weekly list only on Weekly)
If mismatch persists, keep debugging until fixed.

DELIVERABLE:
- Name the two conflicting sources of truth you found (variable names + file/line).
- Describe exactly what you changed to unify them.
- flutter test must pass.
