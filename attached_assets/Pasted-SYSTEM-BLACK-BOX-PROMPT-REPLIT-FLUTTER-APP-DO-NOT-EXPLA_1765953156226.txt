SYSTEM / BLACK-BOX PROMPT (REPLIT FLUTTER APP) — DO NOT EXPLAIN

Refine the Profile screen UI to improve clarity, density, and calmness for beta users, without changing any underlying logic, routes, or data models. This is UI/UX polish only.

Goals

Reduce vertical bloat

Emphasize identity and progress

De-emphasize unfinished or zero-state noise

Make Profile feel supportive, not overwhelming

Preserve future features without distracting from core usage

Requirements
1) Identity Card (Top Section)

Keep avatar, name, XP, streak, and equipped title

Reduce vertical padding by ~20–24px

Slightly reduce avatar glow radius

Tighten spacing between:

Name → XP/Streak

XP/Streak → Title

No redesign — spacing and density only

2) “Your Journey So Far” Section

Keep the section and copy

Hide or visually de-emphasize rows where the value is 0:

Quizzes completed

Reflections written

Quest steps finished

Plan days completed

Always show:

Chapters completed

Current streak

Reduce card padding slightly to make this feel like a snapshot, not a dashboard

3) Tools Section (Utility Focus)

Keep Tools as a simple list, not tiles

Slightly reduce row height

Reduce icon size slightly

Increase right-arrow contrast for clearer tap affordance

Tools should feel like utilities (settings-style), not feature showcases

4) Explore Section (Future Vision, Low Pressure)

Keep “Explore (Coming Soon)” collapsed by default

Add a subtle subtitle under the header:

“Features expanding over time”

When expanded:

Keep existing rows and routes unchanged

Slightly dim icons or labels to signal non-core status

This section should feel optional, not required

5) Titles & Achievements (Secondary Emphasis)

Keep both sections

Move them below Explore (already done)

Reduce vertical padding around these sections

Increase header clarity slightly (font weight or spacing), but keep them visually secondary

Do NOT add new interactions

6) Global Polish Rules

Reduce vertical spacing between all major sections (target ~16px instead of 24–28px)

Maintain existing card styles and theme

Do NOT change:

XP logic

Streak logic

Navigation

Routes

Data models

Quest or Bible behavior

Output

Update UI only

App should feel calmer, denser, and more intentional

Profile should support the core loop, not compete with it
