You are the Replit Agent in repo: ScriptureQuest/scripturequest-app.

GOAL: Fix Replit Flutter Web Preview (it’s currently failing to compile/run). This is a tooling/runtime issue, NOT a Verse-of-the-Day logic change.
DO NOT modify quest logic, VOTD logic, UI copy, or any app behavior unless required to make web compile.

HARD RULES:
1) Do NOT change app features/logic. Only fix web build/preview plumbing.
2) Do NOT add/remove dependencies unless compilation forces it.
3) Keep changes minimal, revertable, and explain each change.

WHAT TO DO (in order):

A) CAPTURE THE REAL ERROR
- Run `flutter run -d chrome --verbose` and capture the FIRST Dart error lines that explain the failure (not just the stack trace).
- If the error is truncated in the UI, rerun and pipe to a file: `flutter run -d chrome --verbose 2>&1 | tee /tmp/web_run.log`
- In your response, quote the first 30–60 lines around the actual error message (the root cause line).

B) CLEAN REPLIT/FLUTTER CACHES (safe)
Run these commands:
- `flutter clean`
- `rm -rf .dart_tool build`
- `flutter pub get`
Then try again:
- `flutter run -d chrome`

C) IF STILL FAILING: CHECK COMMON WEB BREAKERS
Only if build still fails, check/fix these minimal items:
1) `web/index.html` base href
   - Ensure `<base href="/">` (or correct for Replit; if your app is served at root in preview, `/` is correct)
2) `web/manifest.json` + icons paths existence (missing referenced files can break build)
3) Any web-only imports guarded incorrectly (dart:io usage in web build)
   - Search for web-incompatible imports and fix with conditional imports or `kIsWeb` guards ONLY where necessary.
   - Do NOT refactor; apply the smallest guard to unblock compile.

D) CONFIRM PREVIEW RUNS
- Preview must load and show the app UI (Quest Hub is fine).
- Provide the exact command that succeeds.
- State clearly whether this is fixed for `flutter run -d chrome` and Replit Preview.

DELIVERABLES:
- List exactly which files changed (if any).
- If no code changes were needed, say so and report the clean commands that fixed it.
- Do NOT touch VOTD/quests behavior.

Start now with step A: run `flutter run -d chrome --verbose`, identify the root error line, then proceed through the steps.
