TASK: Fix Verse of the Day TEXT LOADING. This is NOT a UI task.
Current UI already shows reference (e.g., Colossians 3:23) but displays “Unable to load verse text”.
We must make the service/provider actually return/populate the verse TEXT reliably.

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE):
1) Edit ONLY Verse-of-the-Day data retrieval + provider state. Do NOT change quest logic, filter pills, or any other screen behavior.
2) Do NOT reintroduce “Tap to read this verse” anywhere. If you see it, remove it, but otherwise do not change UI copy.
3) Do NOT add any AbsorbPointer/IgnorePointer/ModalBarrier that blocks the screen.
4) Ensure loading flags ALWAYS clear via try/catch/finally. No infinite loading.
5) Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing Provider/services.

WHAT “FIXED” MEANS:
- On Quest Hub, Today’s Verse shows:
  - Label + reference + the verse TEXT (actual scripture text)
- If network/source fails, show “Unable to load verse text” but only after a real attempt and log the error in debug.
- On web preview (flutter run -d chrome), the verse text must appear within a couple seconds.

PROCESS YOU MUST FOLLOW:
A) Locate the current VOTD model/provider/service and where the verse reference is chosen.
   - Find where Colossians 3:23 comes from, and where verse text should be fetched.
B) Identify why text is missing:
   - Is the text field never fetched?
   - Is it async but not awaited?
   - Is it failing silently?
   - Is it being dropped when mapping JSON/model?
C) Implement the smallest fix so the provider ends with BOTH reference and non-empty text.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
1) Provider state must include:
   - votdReference (String)
   - votdText (String? or String)
   - votdLoading (bool)
   - votdError (String? optional)
2) VOTD load flow must be:

   set votdLoading = true; votdError = null; notifyListeners();
   try {
     // Step 1: get todays reference (existing behavior)
     // Step 2: fetch verse text for that reference (ensure awaited)
     // Step 3: set votdText = fetchedText.trim()
     // Step 4: if fetchedText empty => throw or set votdError
   } catch (e, st) {
     votdError = e.toString();
     if (kDebugMode) print('[VOTD] error: $e'); print(st);
   } finally {
     votdLoading = false;
     notifyListeners();
   }

3) If there is currently a “pool” of references:
   - keep it, but ensure the text is fetched for the chosen reference.
4) If there is already a Bible text source in-app (local JSON/db):
   - prefer that (no network).
   - Otherwise use the existing remote source you already have (do not add new deps unless absolutely required).
5) Add debug logs in kDebugMode:
   - chosen reference
   - whether text was found and its length
   - any error

CACHE (minimal, optional but preferred):
- Cache the resolved reference+text for todayKey (YYYY-MM-DD local) in SharedPreferences so it doesn’t re-fetch repeatedly.
- If cache exists for todayKey, load it immediately.

VERIFICATION (MUST DO):
1) Run `flutter test` (must pass).
2) Run `flutter run -d chrome` (or restart preview) and confirm:
   - Today’s Verse shows verse text (not “Unable to load verse text”).
3) In your response, list EXACT files changed and why.

Start now by finding the VOTD provider/service and tracing how the reference is selected and where the verse text should be populated.
