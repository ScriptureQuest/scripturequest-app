You are working in the ScriptureQuest Flutter app in Replit (repo: ScriptureQuest/scripturequest-app).
CRITICAL: The last changes BROKE the app:
- Verse of the Day is stuck on a persistent “Loading verse…” state.
- Quest filter pills are stuck (Reflection stays selected; tapping pills does nothing).
- The quests system is effectively not working now.
Fix this NOW with minimal changes. Do NOT add new architecture. Do NOT refactor unrelated code.

========================
NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
========================
1) Do NOT block the entire Quest Hub screen during Verse-of-the-Day loading.
   - Absolutely NO AbsorbPointer/IgnorePointer/ModalBarrier wrapping the whole page based on VOTD loading.
   - VOTD loading UI must be LOCAL to the VOTD card only.
2) All async loading flags MUST clear in a finally block so they can’t get stuck forever.
3) The filter pill highlight MUST match the currently displayed list (single source of truth).
4) Daily/weekly quests must load and remain interactive even if VOTD fails to load.

========================
STEP 1 — FIND ROOT CAUSE (DO THIS FIRST)
========================
Locate where the Quest Hub UI is frozen:
- Search for AbsorbPointer / IgnorePointer / ModalBarrier / GestureDetector overlays in:
  - lib/screens/quest_hub_screen.dart
  - any widgets used by Quest Hub
Remove or scope them so they do NOT prevent taps on filter pills or quest cards.

Locate why VOTD loading is stuck:
- Find the provider/service method that fetches Verse of the Day.
- Ensure it sets loading true BEFORE fetch and ALWAYS sets loading false in finally.
- If the fetch throws or returns missing text, still clear loading and show a small fallback message.

========================
STEP 2 — FIX VOTD (WITHOUT BREAKING QUESTS)
========================
Desired VOTD behavior:
- Always show label + verse reference.
- Show verse text if present.
- If verse text not yet available: show “Loading verse…” ONLY in the verse text area.
- If fetch fails or returns empty text: show “Unable to load verse text” (small, subtle), but do not affect the rest of the screen.
- Tapping the card can still open the passage, but text should not require a tap.

Implementation constraints:
- Keep changes minimal.
- No new global loading gates.
- Ensure VOTD service/provider returns reference + text (or updates provider once text arrives).

========================
STEP 3 — FIX FILTER PILLS (UNSTICK + SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
========================
- Identify the one state that decides which quest list is shown (Today / Weekly / Reflection / Events).
- Make pill selection read from that same state.
- Make pill onTap update that same state.
- Remove any duplicate “selectedIndex” or local UI state that conflicts with provider state.
- Ensure tapping pills immediately switches the displayed list and highlight.

========================
STEP 4 — QUEST REPETITION SYSTEM (VERIFY NOT BROKEN)
========================
If you already implemented caching/rotation, verify it still works:
- Daily quests: stable for local YYYY-MM-DD; reopen app should not regenerate.
- Weekly quests: stable for YYYY-WW; avoid repeating last week set if possible.
- Uses SharedPreferences keys for saved IDs + rolling history.
- Debug logs in kDebugMode: todayKey/weekKey, loaded vs generated, chosen IDs.
If any of this logic is missing OR currently broken by the recent changes, fix it now with minimal edits.

========================
STEP 5 — VERIFY + TESTS
========================
Run:
- flutter test
- flutter run -d chrome (quick sanity)
Verify manually in preview:
- Quest Hub loads and is interactive.
- Pills switch lists and highlight correctly.
- VOTD shows reference and either text, or “Loading verse…” briefly, then text; never infinite loading.
- Quests still load even if VOTD fails.

DELIVERABLES:
- Provide a clear summary of what files were changed and why.
- Ensure no regressions and no new UX blockers.
