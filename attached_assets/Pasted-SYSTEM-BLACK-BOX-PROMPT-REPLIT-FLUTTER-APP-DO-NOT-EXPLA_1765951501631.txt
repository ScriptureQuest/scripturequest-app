SYSTEM / BLACK-BOX PROMPT (REPLIT FLUTTER APP) — DO NOT EXPLAIN

We are preparing the app for beta retention. Focus is clarity and calm, not feature breadth.

TASK 1 — Fix Verse of the Day Text (must show real verse when available)

Problem:
- Quest Hub shows a Verse of the Day reference (e.g. “2 Corinthians 12:9”)
- But often shows placeholder text: “Tap to read this verse”
- The verse text exists elsewhere in the Bible data, but is not being resolved

Fix:
- Parse the Verse of the Day reference into book, chapter, verse
- Retrieve the verse text from the same data source used by the Bible reader
- Display the actual verse text when found
- Only show “Tap to read this verse” if the verse truly cannot be resolved

Rules:
- Do NOT substitute a different verse (no mismatches ever)
- Do NOT add external APIs
- Do NOT change how the Verse of the Day reference is chosen
- Add debug logging in kDebugMode if verse text cannot be found

TASK 2 — Simplify Profile Screen for Beta Focus

Goal:
Make Profile feel optional, calm, and non-overwhelming.

Changes:
- Keep the top identity card (avatar, name, XP, title)
- Slightly tighten vertical spacing only (no redesign)

Reduce clutter:
- Remove the large multi-tile “tools” grid OR convert it to a simple list with ONLY:
  - Journal
  - Favorites
  - Settings
  - Friends (label “Friends (Beta)” if not fully functional)

Explore section:
- Move Reading Plans / Avatar & Cosmetics / Community / Play & Learn into a single section
- Title: “Explore (Coming Soon)”
- Default state: collapsed
- When expanded: show existing navigation rows
- Do NOT create new routes or screens

De-emphasize:
- Keep “Your Titles” and “Achievements”
- Move them below Explore
- Reduce padding so they feel secondary

Safety:
- Do NOT remove routes
- Do NOT change XP, streaks, quests, or backend logic
- UI/presentation changes only

OUTPUT:
Provide a STATUS UPDATE with:
- Goal
- What changed
- What did NOT change
- Files touched
- Quick test checklist

END PROMPT
