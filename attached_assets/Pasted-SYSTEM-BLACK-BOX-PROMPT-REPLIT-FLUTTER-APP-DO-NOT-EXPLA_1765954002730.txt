SYSTEM / BLACK-BOX PROMPT (REPLIT FLUTTER APP) — DO NOT EXPLAIN

Add high-ROI UX polish: pull-to-refresh + subtle haptics, plus a few safe micro-polish items that do NOT change logic.

SCOPE RULES (HARD)
- Do NOT change quest generation, XP/streak logic, expiration rules, completion flow logic, storage schemas, routes, or data models.
- UI/UX polish only.
- No new screens. No new features that require backend changes.

A) PULL-TO-REFRESH
1) Quest Hub
- Wrap the main scroll view in RefreshIndicator.
- onRefresh should re-bind state and refresh UI:
  - re-read quests from existing services/provider
  - re-read streak display
  - re-bind VOTD display (do NOT rotate/change the VOTD selection)
- Do NOT regenerate quests or reset day keys.
- Use a small 300–500ms await delay only if necessary for smooth UX.

2) Profile
- Wrap the main scroll view in RefreshIndicator.
- onRefresh should re-bind profile stats + streak + titles/achievements UI from existing provider/state.
- No logic changes; just re-render and re-read current values.

B) HAPTICS (SUBTLE ONLY)
- Use system haptics only (HapticFeedback).
- Add haptics ONLY to:
  1) Complete Quest action (lightImpact)
  2) Complete Chapter action (lightImpact)
  3) Switching Quest Hub filter chips (selectionClick)
  4) Expanding/collapsing Explore on Profile (selectionClick)
- Do NOT add haptics to scrolling, normal navigation taps, or list scrolling.

C) SAFE MICRO-POLISH (BUNDLE TO SAVE CREDITS)
1) Loading/Empty State Clarity (text-only)
- If a quest filter shows zero items, show a calm one-liner:
  - Today/Tonight: “You’re done for now. Check back later.”
  - Weekly: “No weekly quests right now.”
  - Reflection: “No reflection prompts right now.”
  - Events: “No events active right now.”
- No new logic—just UI text when lists are empty.

2) Tap Affordance Consistency
- Ensure all tappable cards/rows (Tools items, Explore items, Today’s Verse card, Continue Reading card) use the same InkWell/Ripple behavior and hit target sizing (min 48px height).
- No visual redesign; just consistent touch behavior.

3) Minor Spacing Normalization
- Normalize vertical spacing between major sections to ~16px where inconsistent (Quest Hub + Profile).
- Do not redesign; adjust padding/margins only.

OUTPUT
Provide a final STATUS UPDATE in the standard format:
- Goal
- What changed
- What did NOT change
- Files touched (exact paths)
- Key logic notes
- Quick test checklist
- Known risks/edge cases

END PROMPT
